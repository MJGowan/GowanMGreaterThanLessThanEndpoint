Greater Than or Less Than - Endpoint
In this assignment we enter two numbers into the url and it should say which of them is greater than or lesser than the other, in a way that is compatible with postman

Peer review: Andrew Nilsson - The inputs work well in postman. Good job making the string look like 2 lines.

INSTRUCTIONS
Before anything, open the code in VSCode and run/debug the code. This should lead to a new tab opening, labelled localhost. Copy and paste the URL from that new tab, into the Postman "GET" area. Then, add to the end of the URL like this:
//https://localhost:xxxx/Comparison/Compare/x/x
The xxxx should be the 4-digit number individual to your computer. Then you wil have /Comparison/Compare, and in the next two spaces I have labelled, you will enter numbers of your choice. Then, hit "Send". Text should appear stating whether each number is greater than or lesser than the other.
